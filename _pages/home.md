excerpt: A collection of alevin-fry quantified single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq datsets 
---

## Introduction

The raw data for many single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq experiments is publicly available.  However, certain datasets are used _again and again_, to demonstrate data processing in tutorials, as benchmark datasets for novel methods (e.g. for clustering, dimensionality reduction, cell type identification, etc.).  In particular, 10x Genomics hosts various publicly available datasets generated using their technology and processed via their Cell Ranger software [on their website for download](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets).

We have created a [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io)-based `alevin-fry` workflow that one can use to easily quantify single-cell RNA-sequencing data in a single workflow.  The pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/10x-requant).  To test out this initial pipeline, we have begun to reprocess the publicly-available datasets collected from the 10x website. We have focused the initial effort on standard single-cell and single-nucleus gene-expression data generated using the Chromium v2 and v3 chemistries, but hope to expand the pipeline to more complex protocols soon (e.g. feature barcoding experiments) and process those data as well.  We note that these more complex protocols can already be processed with `alevin-fry` (see the [alevin-fry tutorials](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-fry-tutorials/)), but these have just not yet been incorprated into the automated Nextflow-based workflow linked above.

Additionally, to make interacting with these data as simple as possible in standard R and Python environments, we have added functions to the [`roe`](https://github.com/combine-lab/roe) and [`pyroe`](https://github.com/combine-lab/pyroe) packages to easily and programatically download these data and make them available as a [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html) or [AnnData object](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage-principles.html#anndata) respectively.

### Processed datasets:

In this section, we list the datasets we have re-processed from the [10x website](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets) to date, as well as the link to the quantification result generated by `alevin-fry`. Note that the quantification results are stored as `tar` files that can be obtained from the corresponding Box link.
