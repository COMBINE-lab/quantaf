# 10x-requant

## Introduction
10x Genomics provided various publicly available datasets on their website for free downloading (https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets).

To stop re-inventing the wheel, here we introduce a Nextflow-based alevin-fry workflow that one can use to quantify arbitrary number of single-cell RNA-sequencing projects (https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/10x-requant) in one command, and we also provide the link of the quantification results for the datasets we have collected from 10x website.
